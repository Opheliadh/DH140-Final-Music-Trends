# Music preference changes over 2019 ~ 2021 from Top 200 Songs on Spotify Global Chart

## Introduction to Research Question

  Pandemic quarantines have largely altered people’s schedules and daily routines. Three years into the pandemic, people around the world have experienced multiple phases of COVID infection and different quarantine measures. We are interested to see how music preferences - measured by genre popularity - changes over different periods of COVID surge and drops, full lockdowns and flexible quarantines, summer and winter. Specifically, how does song attributes, such as tempor, valence, chord, associate with a song’s popularity? What genre of music do people prefer during the first lockdowns in spring 2020 (or end of 2019, depending on one’s location), versus a semi-lockdown where people can go to the public with vaccination, such as spring 2021. Essentially, with regard to the ongoing pandemic, how did the relationship between genre popularity and song attributes change over 2019 - 2021 for top 200 songs on Spotify Global Chart? 

## Importance of the research

  Our research will assist others with sentimental analysis during the era of the Covid-19 pandemic. Historians in the future could gain better insights about COVID influenced music preferences by looking at our research. By comparing musical tastes before the pandemic to after the pandemic - 2019 data - we could point out potential differences, if there are any. Our research could assist marketing firms and advertising agencies to understand their audience better, as music is not only an art, and musical preferences are not just psychological preferences, but also economic. 

## Data Source

  The dataset that we will be using will be collected from Spotify Weekly Top 200 Songs globally in 2020 and 2021. We retrieved the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sashankpillai/spotify-top-200-charts-20202021). The dataset includes various song attributes like Danceability, Acousticness, Instrumentalness, Liveness, Loudness, Speechiness, etc. These columns will allow us to further study the characteristics of the song, whether it’s upbeat and cheerful or slow and solemn, or whether it’s using a Major or Minor chord to explore if there is a pattern in the popularity of certain genres and if there’s a correlation between this pattern and current world events. The dataset also includes information on its charting position, Artist, Genres, and Streams, which would help us paint an overall picture that depicts when a genre overtakes another in popularity to answer our research question.

## Intended Analysis and Visualization

  Besides conventional visualizations, we are hoping to explore interactive online maps that users can click on. Each clickable-area on the map represents a time period within the 2019 - 2021 timeframe. As a user clicks on the map, he will be taken to a set of graphs representing genre popularity trends vs. song attributes for that specific time period, with accompanying explanations. Bar graphs, line graphs, and heat maps are being considered, as they could clearly represent nuanced trends for data with multiple attributes.

## Conclusion

  We hope to gain deeper insights into music trends and whether there is an explanation for when certain genres gain more popularity than others through more context obtained through research. The data visualizations will also help us deduce a general sentiment of a time period by connecting the characteristics of popular songs filtered specifically for that period. Lastly, since the dataset that we’re using is obtained from Spotify, a music platform used by millions of listeners around the world, we hope that our findings are generalizable to the entire world rather than a specific country or culture.
